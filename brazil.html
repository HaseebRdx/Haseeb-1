    <p>Brazil, the largest country in South America, is renowned for its vibrant culture, diverse ecosystems, and
        sprawling landscapes. Home to over 200 million people, it is the world's fifth-largest country by both area and
        population. Brazil's Amazon Rainforest, often called the "lungs of the Earth," is a biodiversity hotspot, while
        its dynamic cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro showcase its economic and cultural energy. Known for its
        samba music, Carnival festival, and love of football, Brazil has a rich heritage influenced by Indigenous,
        African, and European traditions. Its capital, Brasília, is celebrated for its modernist architecture and urban
        planning.</p>
